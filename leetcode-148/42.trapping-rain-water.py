# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
# 
# 
# The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In
# this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks
